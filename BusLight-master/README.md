# BusLight
<p1>Welcome To BusLight Project.</p1>
<h1>What is the aim of this project?</h1>
<p1>The aim is to give priority to public busses.</p1>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p1>The program works with Real-Time data. Bus Intensity informations are taken and uploaded by arduino to a webserver. To measure route intensities, program uses an car detection algorithm powered my CV2 library. The program compares both bus and route intensities in oder to consider which one passes first. After the consideration stage is done, program regulates the colors of traffic lights.</p1>
<h1>Planned Updates and Information</h1>
<p1>Program will be working with Arduino Uno to visualize the traffic light corrdinations.</p1>
