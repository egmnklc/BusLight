# BusLight
<h1>Welcome To BusLight Project.</h1>
<h1>What is the aim of this project?</h1>
<p1>The goal is to give priority to public busses.</p1>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p1>The program works with Real-Time datas. Bus Intensity informations are taken and uploaded by arduinos to a webserver. To measure route intensities, program uses an car detection algorith powered my CV2 library. The program compares both bus and route intensities in oder to consider which bus should pass first. After the consideration stage is done, program regulates the colors of traffic lights.</p1>
<h1>Planned Updates and Information</h1>
<p1>Program will be working with Arduino Uno to visualize the traffic light corrdinations.</p1>
