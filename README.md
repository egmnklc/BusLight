<h1>Project: <i>BusLight</i></h1>

<p1><br>BusLight is a project that <b>aims to prevent traffic congestion in intersections</b>. The program uses a real-time mp4 video or CCTV footage in order to determine the amount of vehicles. It then simply passes them through a logic gate and logs the data for future analysis. As a result, traffic lights' duration are arranged.</p1>
